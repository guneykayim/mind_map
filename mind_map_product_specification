mind_map_product_specification

This is mind map for product specification, v1.0

it is a classical mind map product
it is a web application
in v1.0 we want to host it locally only
it is a single page application
it is a product for personal use

features:

app will start with a mind map with single node
user can add nodes to the mind map
user can delete nodes from the mind map
user can edit nodes in the mind map
user can move nodes in the mind map

each node can have:
- text
- color
- sub nodes
- border line style (solid, dashed, dotted)
- arrows to sub nodes
- arrow line style (solid, dashed, dotted)
- nodes will be draggable
- nodes will have round corners

if a user hovers a node, it will show a + icon on 4 sides of the node
if a user clicks on one of the + icons, it will add a new node to the mind map
when a new node is added, it will come with arrows from the parent node
moving a node will also move the arrows from the parent node


user can save/export the mind map
user can load/import the mind map

there will a static left pane
left pane will have 
- save button 
- load button

task list:
1. [+] determine the tech stack
2. [+] create a mind map with single node
3. [+] make the node text editable
4. [+] make the node draggable
5. [+] add + icons on the node when hovered
6. [+] add a new node to the mind map when + icon is clicked
7. [+] added nodes should be connected to the parent node with an arrow 
8. [+] make sure when the node is dragged, all the arrow connections are maintained 
9. [+] Allow nodes to be deleted (by delete key, and it should also pop up are you sure dialog)
10. [+] Make canvas zoomable: 
    default zoom should be 100% but user should be able to zoom in and out
    max zoom should be 200%
    min zoom should be 10%
    place a sticky zoom control in the right bottom corner of the canvas
    zoom control should have + and - buttons
    zoom control should have a slider as well
    zoom control should have a reset button (100%)
11. [+] Make the canvas infinite and scrollable
    user should be able to scroll the canvas in any direction
    user should be able to scroll the canvas by dragging the canvas
    user should be able to scroll the canvas by using mouse wheel
    user should be able to scroll the canvas by using touchpad
    add a button to reset the canvas scroll position to the center
12. [+] remove support for adding nodes to top and bottom
    we will only support adding nodes to left and right
    remove + icons from top and bottom
    delete all code related to top and bottom nodes
13. [+] Make zooming in the center of the canvas if it is done via canvas controls, not top left
    if the screen is dragged, the center of the screen should be the center of the canvas
    also allow zooming with mouse wheel when ctrl is pressed
    don't change any other behavior of the zooming
14. [+] Simplify App.jsx
15. [ ] Allow multiple nodes to be selected and dragged together
16. [ ] Allow multiple nodes to be selected and deleted together
17. [ ] Improve node slot finding algorithm such that when child nodes add new child nodes, those shouldn't overlap
18. [ ] Add auto layout button, when pressed it should layout the nodes in a way that they don't overlap and they are spread out and they should have equal spacing between them
19. [ ] Child nodes shouldn't be able to add a node in it's parent direction
20. [ ] add the export and import functionality
21. [ ] add auto save functionality
22. [ ] if I try to refresh the screen, warn the user about unsaved changes
23. [ ] add the undo and redo functionality
24. [ ] Improve node text editing experience
    instead of updating the width of the node only, update it's position if necessary (left child and root node)
known bugs/issues:
1. [] when a node is added in zoomed out mode to a place that is outside the original canvas size, it's arrows are not drawn at all
2. [+] arrow lengths for right and left child nodes are not the same
3. [+] when a node enters text edit mode it's width increases, it should stay as is
    it could be a css issue or it could be because we are using a separate component
4. [+] a node should be draggable from the text area as well, not just the border, previously it was done like this because it was simpler, but now this is a bad UX. also it is important not to break text editing functionality when adding this drag option, double click to edit text should still work
5. [] sometimes when a child node is added, it causes parent node to jump to another place, mostly top left, there isn't an exact repro though, not sure why it happens
6. [] when "reset view" button is pressed when the zoom level is different than 100% it doesn't reset to the correct center. in case zoom level is smaller center becomes closer to top left, and if the zoom level is bigger, center becomes closer to right bottom.
