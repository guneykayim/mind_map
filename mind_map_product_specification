mind_map_product_specification

This is mind map for product specification, v1.0

it is a classical mind map product
it is a web application
in v1.0 we want to host it locally only
it is a single page application
it is a product for personal use

features:

app will start with a mind map with single node
user can add nodes to the mind map
user can delete nodes from the mind map
user can edit nodes in the mind map
user can move nodes in the mind map

each node can have:
- text
- color
- sub nodes
- border line style (solid, dashed, dotted)
- arrows to sub nodes
- arrow line style (solid, dashed, dotted)
- nodes will be draggable
- nodes will have round corners

if a user hovers a node, it will show a + icon on 4 sides of the node
if a user clicks on one of the + icons, it will add a new node to the mind map
when a new node is added, it will come with arrows from the parent node
moving a node will also move the arrows from the parent node


user can save/export the mind map
user can load/import the mind map

there will a static left pane
left pane will have 
- save button 
- load button

PO task list (must have):
1. [+] Improve node slot finding algorithm such that when child nodes add new child nodes, no node should overlap, here is a more detailed explanation with example of how node slot finding right now works and how it should work:
- when we add child nodes from a node, current slot finding algorithm makes sure all the child nodes from the same parent doesn't overlap. this is how it works right now.
- what I need is this: let's say from root node I added 2 right childs. let's call these right_child_1 and right_child_2. then I add 2 right childs from right_child_1. let's call these right_child_1_1 and right_child_1_2. then when I add 1 right child from right_child_2, it overlaps with right_child_1_2. I don't want that, if a new node being added is going to overlap with any other node, it should be handled and prevented.
- to prevent, what needs to be done is, moving the already existing node to upwards or downwards. but not just the node should be moved up/down. that node and all the nodes from that node to the root should be moved up/down bbby the same amount.
2. [ ] add export as png button


P1 task list (should have):
1. [ ] Add auto layout button, when pressed it should layout the nodes in a way that they don't overlap and they are spread out and they should have equal spacing between them
2. [ ] Improve node text editing experience
    instead of updating the width of the node only, update it's position if necessary (left child and root node)

P2 task list (good to have but stretch):
1. [ ] add auto save functionality



known bugs/issues:
1. [ ] export button doesn't ask file name in Safari
2. [ ] When a node is first added, it is added as a right or left child. But when a node is moved to another direction, it arrow rendering is changed, but not which type of child it is changes. e.g. I have a right child, which can only have a right child. but when I move that right child to left, arrow coming to it makes it left child, but it doesn't actually become a left child, it still can only add a right child.
